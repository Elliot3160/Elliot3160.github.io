                            Welcome to Palaeoclimates and Our Warming World! In this series of websites we will voyage through time to worlds past and examine how the climate has changed at the will of both the earth system and more recently, humans. Taking the geological perspective will make it clear that our planet has changed dramatically - both in climate and animal life. We know that our climate has changed rapidly from the layering of rocks and the life forms preserved within them, which are known as fossils. Together they record the succession of climates and biology over incomprehensible periods of time...whoever said rocks were boring!?

                            A Brief Introduction
                        </h2>
                        Palaeoclimates are periods in Earth's history which correspond to geological periods. Each period has a unique climate, which includes new, or persisting forms of life which will continue to evolve. Each climate leaves its signature on the Earth - manifested as different types of rock. Rocks formed by climates are sedimentary in nature, consisting of compacted grains of rock. You may already be familiar with sandstone - in this instance, sand grains (usually quartz and feldspar) become compacted to form a solid mass of sandstone. Subject to forces of erosion over millions of years, it will weather down to pebbles and then grains, ready to be compacted and cemented once again. In the rock record, sedimentary rocks form layers which are known as strata. The first law of geology states that younger strata overlies older strata. This means that the deeper through the rock strata you go, the older the rocks become.
