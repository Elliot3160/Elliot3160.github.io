            Hi, my name is Elliot! I hold a First Class BSc Honours degree in physical geography from the University of Southampton. I will continue my higher education at the world renowned Centre for Quaternary Research in September 2024. After the MSc, I would like to pursue a Doctorate degree!

            Coupled with my undergraduate degree and two internships in climate science analytics with Atoma Research, I have been inspired to build my own website with the aim of educating and enhancing the accessibility to climate science data. As a palaeoclimatatologist in the making, I believe that the optimal way to spread awareness of  current climate change is to call upon previous geological periods to which effective comparisons to our modern climate can be made. Our human activities primarily burning fossil fuels, is moving us rapidly towards these periods in time where the climate was once much more unstable. This should be a concern to all 8 billion of us alive today because the geological record demonstrates that life is subject to extinction events - the largest wiping out 95% of all life on Earth  <b>(stay tuned for a series of websites discussing the major extinction events!)</b>
        </p>

            This website aims to balance scientific data with accessibility, by conveying the facts and numbers in a clear, catchy and concise manner. Therefore, all information I publish comes directly from the scientific literature and is cited appropriately. Whilst my data and website is for open use, there are options to support my work by payments for bespoke insights written about the latest climate topics. I am happy for my data and website to be used in your work, but a citation using the appropriate link would be much appreciated!
        </p>
